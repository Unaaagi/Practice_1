            By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products from Shop, the Customer agrees that it is bound by these Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via the internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to these Terms and Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by the Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by both parties.

It as agreed that should the Customer fail for any reason to acquire the quantity of Products sold then without limiting Shop' other rights and remedies the unit price charged for the goods sold may be amended to take into account any variation in the total quantity purchased by the Customer. Prices include GST, but do not include any other tax or duty, which is in addition to the price and is to be paid by the Customer at the time of payment for the Products.

            Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card Direct Debit, the Customer must provide notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in ownership of the business to allow Shop sufficient time to contact the new owner to obtain and confirm new Credit Card information if applicable.

         <p class="text_last">
